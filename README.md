# 2-D-kinematics

A basic simulation of 2D kinematics with simulated friction and restitution. Currently there is no air friction, may be added in future updates.

# Mechanics

Simple 1D translation physics formulae were used to determine change in velocities, displacement. Acceleration due to gravity was updated constantly depending upon distance from centre of gravity of Earth.
